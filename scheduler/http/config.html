      <strong>Selecting Capture Devices</strong><br>
        Select which devices you want TV Scheduler Pro to use is the first thing 
        you need to do, this lets TV Scheduler Pro know what devices you have installed 
        in your system and which of these devices you want TV Scheduler Pro to use. 
        In the case where you have more than one device installed in your 
        system you will be able to select multiple devices and also set the order 
        that TV Scheduler Pro uses them in. The card selection is done on the Device Selection 
        page.

      <strong>Adding Channels</strong><br>
        Setting up your channels is the next thing that you need to do before 
        you can use TV Scheduler Pro, you have two choices here, the easiest is using 
        the scan option &quot;Auto-Scan&quot; and TV Scheduler Pro will scan 
        your local frequencies for stations and give you the option of adding 
        any detected stations and programs available on that station as channels.
      The other option is to add the channels manually &quot;Add Custom&quot;, 
        you will need to know certain things about the station like its frequency 
        and also details about the programs the station has like the program ID, 
        video and audio program ID's etc.

      <strong>Set your Capture Path</strong><br>
        The capture path is where you want TV Scheduler Pro to put your recorded 
        data, by default TV Scheduler Pro captures to a directory under the installation 
        directory called &quot;capture&quot;, you can change this by adding new capture paths. 
        The capture paths are set up on the Paths and Names Settings page.

      <strong>Test Run</strong><br>
        Once you have set up the basic configuration requirements you can then run a simple test to make sure 
        TV Scheduler Pro is working. By Adding a simple 5 minute capture as a test you will be able to 
        check if TV Scheduler Pro can use your hardware and you have set up and configured it correctly. Use the following link 
        to add a test capture. Click on today's date, then on the schedule details page change duration to 5 and select a channel
        then click submit, this will add a test capture, it might be a good idea to test each of your added channels.
