<b>EPG Auto-Add System</b><br>
The EPG Auto-Add system allows you to set up a list of automatically
created schedules that match programs start and stop times from the EPG.
These matches are based on keyword, time and day of week, they also contain a number
of settings the created schedule items will inherit when created,
these settings include start and end time buffer, capture type and
post capture task.
<p>

The Auto-Add run can be run automatically immediately after new EPG data is imported, or manually if required.<p>

When the Auto-Add action is called the following process takes place:<p>

All current none running EPG Auto-Add schedule items are removed form the system.<br>
The system starts looking for matches using the following search order
<ol>
<li>For each Auto-Add item in the list starting from the top of the list</li>
<li>Then for each Mapped Channel (none mapped channels are ignored) in the order that that appear on the channel map page</li>
<li>Then for each EPG program for that mapped channel in start time order</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

The above means that the priority that Auto-Add items are matched and added are as follows
<ul>
<li>Auto-Add list order -> Channel Map order -> EPG item start time</li>
</ul>

When a match is found it might be possible that this EPG program has an existing schedule already associated with it.
The "Already Exists Detection" mechanism can be used to check the schedule list for schedules that might have already
been created from this EPG program.
