<b>End Buffer EPG Addition</b><br>

When adding Schedule items using the EPG, i.e. clicking on an EPG item and selecting add schedule, this value is used to add a number of
minutes to the total capture time.
<br>
<br>
The number of minutes added is dependant on the duration of the EPG program, for every 60 minutes of duration the value of End Buffer EPG Addition
in minutes will be added.
<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
End Buffer EPG Addition=10<br>
An EPG program, a movie, of 130 min will have an extra 20 minutes of capture time added to the schedule.<br>
<br>
This is useful for making sure you get the end of long movies and sports shows.
