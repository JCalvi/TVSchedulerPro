<td valign="top">

<b>Seconds for system wake up</b><br>
      The amount of time before the next schedule that a wake up call gets sent to the PC.
      If this option is set to something above ZERO when TV Scheduler Pro is about to start a capture it will trigger a wake up 
      command on the PC, if the PC is hibernating or suspended it may take some 
      time for it to come back to life, on most systems 45 seconds is fine but 
      you may need to extend this if your pc is taking a long time to wake up.<br><br>
      To disable the wake up call set this to "0".
