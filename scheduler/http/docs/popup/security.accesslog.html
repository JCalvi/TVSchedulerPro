<b>Log access requests</b><br>

This will log to the Scheduler log file all access requests, this is useful for building your authentication list when you need to restrict access to
a particular page.
<p>
You can turn on the logging and find the exact URL and parameter list you need to match for that request to be blocked. You can then build the access 
rule to match it to restrict access for that page/request.
<p>
It is not recommended that you leave this turned on as it will produce a large log file with even moderate interface usage.
