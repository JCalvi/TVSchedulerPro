<b>Authentication</b><br>

User name and password authentication can be used to help secure the TV Scheduler Pro web interface, when enabled you will need to log into the system with a user name and password before you can access the web interface.

<strong style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">WARNING:</strong> You will not be prompted to set a user name and password, the user name and password will be used from the settings page, make sure you have set the user name and password before you enable this option.

Once enabled if you forget it or need to change it you need to access the server.prop file manually.

If you need more than one account or need more precise access control you can set any number of accounts and access rules manually in the authentication.prop file that is loaded in the data directory.
