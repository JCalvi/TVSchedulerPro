<b>Security: Use security CAPTCHA</b><br>

This enables or disables the CAPTCHA Security ID that is required on some of the settings update pages.<p>
<strong style="color:#FF0000;">WARNING:</strong> do not turn this off if you do not know or understand what it means.<p>
It is possible for links to be created on external sites that when clicked on may update your local settings in TV Scheduler Pro due to TV Scheduler Pro being Web based.<p>
An example of this may be that a person creates a link on a forum that has the host <localhost> as the target and the action of say updating your EPG source data URL location, if you click on that link in the external forum and it did work and update TV Scheduler Pro next time TV Scheduler Pro tries to get the EPG data it will load form this new URL that has been set by you clicking on the URL on the forum.<p>
While it is unlikely that the above will happen it is possible and that is why the Security ID system was put in place, if you are disabling this security measure do so knowing that external links may be able to interact with your local setup of TV Scheduler Pro.
