<b>Security: Limit high security settings</b><br>

Some settings are critical to the security of the TV Scheduler Pro system and setting them incorrectly may cause system security or stability issues. In these situations it is by default that you can only set these settings from the local machine that TV Scheduler Pro is running on or localhost as it is referred to in networking terms.<p>
If you are sure your setup is secure from outside interference, or you have set up authentication, you may want to lower this setting to allow changing these settings from any machine on your network.<p>

Currently the only settings that fall under this are the Task items that run external processes.
