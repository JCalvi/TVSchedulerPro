1. Install VS2010
2. Download and install the Windows Software Development Kit version 7.1.
  Note: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31455926/windows-sdk-7-1-setup-failure
  With Windows 10 x64, the setup is blocked by:
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\NET Framework Setup\NDP\v4\Full\Version
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\NET Framework Setup\NDP\v4\Client\Version
    Change both values temporarily to 4.0.30319 and the setup will let you continue.
    Make sure you edit the registry with elevated privileges, otherwise you will not be allowed to change the values.
    This includes taking ownership, adding permissions making the change etc. Revert all when done.
    Note: Currently 4.8.04084 (But this would update with each windows or .net update)
3. I moved C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Lib contents to C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Lib\win32
  This is to allow the configurations to be automatic for platform being built.
  This could also be achieved with a symbolic link, eg: mklink /d "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Lib\win32" "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Lib"
4. I also moved the Java installs to x64 and win32 folders and removed version numbers from folders to allow auto platform building and updating as well.
  e.g. C:\Program Files\Java\x64\jdk\  C:\Program Files\Java\x64\jre  C:\Program Files\Java\win32\jdk\ etc.
5. Build the BaseClasses.sln for all configs and platforms required.
  NOTE: THE CONFIG MUST BE THE SAME AS FOR THE TOOLS.SLN esp UNICODE VS MBCS. I compiled everything with Multi Byte Character Set & changed the Release and Debug configs to this. I also removed the Release_MBCS and Debug_MBCS configs from the solution.
        IF the settings for ALL CONFIGS are not the same then weird linking errors will occur.
6. Make sure the Java installs are available for the util tool - refer config for folder settings, change as required for latest version.

Note:
TSMemoryShare Size is defined in SharedMem.h and was defaulted to 15mb
#define shareDataSize 15000000
//#define shareDataSize 52428800








Other Notes Re VS Express and x64
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1865069/how-to-compile-a-64-bit-application-using-visual-c-2010-express

Here are step by step instructions:

    Download and install the Windows Software Development Kit version 7.1.
      Visual C++ 2010 Express does not include a 64 bit compiler, but the SDK does.
      A link to the SDK: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsserver/bb980924.aspx
    Change your project configuration.
      Go to Properties of your project.
      On the top of the dialogue box there will be a "Configuration" drop-down menu.
      Make sure that selects "All Configurations."
      There will also be a "Platform" drop-down that will read "Win32."
      Finally on the right there is a "Configuration Manager" button - press it.
      In the dialogue that comes up, find your project, hit the Platform drop-down, select New, then select x64.
      Now change the "Active solution platform" drop-down menu to "x64."
      When you return to the Properties dialogue box, the "Platform" drop-down should now read "x64."
    Finally, change your toolset.
      In the Properties menu of your project,
      under Configuration Properties | General, change Platform Toolset from "v100" to "Windows7.1SDK".

These steps have worked for me, anyway. Some more details on step 2 can be found in a reference from Microsoft that a previous poster mentioned: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9yb4317s.aspx.
